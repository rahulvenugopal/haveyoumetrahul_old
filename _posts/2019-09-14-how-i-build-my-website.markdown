Oh, boy. This is going to be a post on `How I created my website` after lots of frustration, hacks and thoughts.

The whole concept of having a website for my online avatar has been haunting me from many years. A part of me was always seeking this. When I came across Quora way back in 2013, I thought Quora will suit me. I can always find/ask a question which fits my blog idea. But after an year into Quora, I realsed Quora is far far away from my idea of the canvas of my online avatar.

Fastforward to  2016 
I used to hangout at hasgeek on Friday's with Hari, Manyu and other friends. I met [Captain nemo](https://captnemo.in/) and [Jaseem](https://blog.jabid.in/) there amidst boardgames. I loved [Saboteur](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9220/saboteur) game. Nemo explained the rules of the game like a true wizard. Nobody had any doubts with rules. That was impressive. Jaseem was talking about 'Emperors of malady' and shooting a list/dictionary of arguments for/against some software stuff (my knowledge of the topic was too low that I coudn't even guess which side he was taking)

First thing I did after reaching hostel was to checkout their website. Nemo's website was brilliant. Jaseem's blog was inspirational, but I liked nemo's website the best. Fast forward, I came across many more websites which gained my attraction. I just fell in love with Bret Victor's [website](http://worrydream.com/). Recently, I liked Jekflix theme from [Thiagorossener](https://jekflix.rossener.com/)

One fine Sunday, I looked up [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to transform plain text into statis websites and blogs. By this time, Earth completed many more revolutions and I am already in my PhD journey. Since [weebly](https://nphy.weebly.com/) was used to manage my department webpage, I was trying that out for my personal blog. To be honest, I got bored with it and didn't feel like a canvas for my online avatar. I migraed to google-sites within a week. I liked the simplicity of things with google-sites. My PhD co-guide [Dr. Nithin Nagaraj](https://sites.google.com/site/nithinnagaraj2/) hosts his website with google sites. That was a good push to consider google sites as my online avatar's canvas.

House and home are two different things. I felt google-sites was like a house. It didn't give me a homely feel. I got back to Quora and wrote some 5-6 blogposts there. I was feeling restless by now. This is 6 years of procrastination and the feeling was overwhelming. I decided to end this restlessness and settle with a canvas which felt like home for my online avatar. I have been moving my online avatar across many houses and still avatar was homeless!!! Quite sad!!! My wife was telling me to build a website from scratch and offered her unconditional technical help:) I don't have time to travel the overhead in terms of learning softwares and database management to host a website. I tried doing that for a day or two and was back to my restless mode.

Enter Jekyll again. I was at peace after reading the Jekyll [philosophy page](https://jekyllrb.com/philosophy/).
-Jekyll is no magic
-It just works
-Content is king
-Stability
-Small and extensible
-Hosted by github

Phew, my online avatar will have a permanent residence soon. I sat peacefully that day. I made up my mind to dedicate some time to learn things to build this home.
Most important thing is, a name for the website. In one of those random meetups, I head about this concept of meeting people who have a profile which is completely orthogonal to ours. The whole idea is to buy coffee to people who are in different walks of life and get their perspective about life. I really got inspired by this and I have been doing this for two years when I was doing my MPhil in Neurosciences (2014-2016)
So the website will be called **haveyoumetrahul** honoring this philosophy.

I went through [Mike Dane's tutorials](https://www.mikedane.com/static-site-generators/jekyll/)
I already knew some rudimentary markdown (All thanks to Pranay). By the way, check out this awesome software called [Typora](https://typora.io/) - A truly minimal markdown editor
