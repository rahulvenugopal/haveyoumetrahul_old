I came across [Max Deutsch's blog](https://medium.com/@maxdeutsch) in medium.
His bio reads **Obsessive learner and product builder**.
His challenge of learning one skill to expert levels in one month was quite inspiring and jaw-dropping.
I have pulled my jaw back to where it was and setting four goals for year 2019.

1. I do some basic rubik's cubing(3 by 3 format) and consistently average below 60 seconds
But, that's quite common among a good amount of cubers
I am setting a goal to average under 40 seconds mark which is close to quarter mile race!
I will go with 5 solves, drop slowest and fastest, average of remaining 3 solves is the **target timing**
**Update1** 
I looked up RiDo's tutorial on intutive F2L using three stories
I realised I forgot T and was relying on J-perm to move edges in last layer
Practiced T and it came back to me within 4/5 solves. Yayyy
One of the biggest surprises in my life happened! badmephisto is Andrej Karpathy!!!
I couldn't contain my emotions and I tweeted to Dr. Karpathy!!!
I plan to learn 2 look-up PLL/OLL to improve speed
Took out my first cube and cleaned it and lubed with Kerala coconut oil
	
2. Challenge 2 is to learn touch typing and hit 70 WPM. My current typing speed as per 10fastfingers is 50WPM
**Update1**
WPM has improved by 3 steps. Currently it is 53 WPM
3. Third is relatively simple and more of an academic interest. Take the MIT Course 9.11: The Human Brain taught by Nancy Kanwisher
**Update1** 
Caught up in research work. Couldn't pull myself to this:(

4. Cut down body weight and reach 62 kg by Dec 30, 2019. Should be able to do 2 minutes plank, 10 pullups and 10 pushups
**Update1** 
Bought badminton rackets and realised my cardio is below average! Today was day 3 playing badminton with my wife for half an hour
