I came across Max Deutsch's blog in medium
His bio reads "Obsessive learner and product builder"
His challenge of learning one skill to expert levels in one month was quite inspiring and jaw-dropping
I have pulled my jaw back to where it was and setting three goals for year 2019
-[]1) I do some basic rubik's cubing(3*3) and consistently average below 60 seconds
But that's common for a good amount of cubers.:rocket:
I am setting a goal to cube under 40 seconds mark which is close to quarter mile race!
	
-[]2) Challenge 2 is to learn touch typing and hit 70 WPM. My current typing speed as per 10fastfingers is 50WPM
	
-[]3) Third is relatively simple and more of an academic interest. Take the MIT-OCW course on :Introduction to Psychology
	
-[]4) Cut down body weight and reach 62 kg. Should be able to do 2 minutes plank, 10 pullups and 10 pushups :rocket:
