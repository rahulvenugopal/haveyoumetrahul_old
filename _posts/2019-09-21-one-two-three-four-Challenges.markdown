I came across [Max Deutsch's blog](https://medium.com/@maxdeutsch) in medium.
His bio reads **Obsessive learner and product builder**
His challenge of learning one skill to expert levels in one month was quite inspiring and jaw-dropping.
I have pulled my jaw back to where it was and setting four goals for year 2019.

1. I do some basic rubik's cubing(3 by 3 format) and consistently average below 60 seconds.
But, that's common among a good amount of cubers.
I am setting a goal to average under 40 seconds mark which is close to quarter mile race!
I will go with 5 solves, drop slowest and fastest, average of remaining 3 solves is the **target timing**
	
2. Challenge 2 is to learn touch typing and hit 70 WPM. My current typing speed as per 10fastfingers is 50WPM
	
3. Third is relatively simple and more of an academic interest. Take the MIT Course 9.11: The Human Brain taught by Nancy Kanwisher
	
4. Cut down body weight and reach 62 kg by Dec 30, 2019. Should be able to do 2 minutes plank, 10 pullups and 10 pushups
