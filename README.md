This is Rahul's personal website. I am a neuroscience researcher pursuing my PhD in the department of Neurophysiology, NIMHANS, Bengaluru

Most of my learnings are adhoc and same holds true for this website also. 
This is always a beta product and I am trying to constantly learn, update and improve this space.
