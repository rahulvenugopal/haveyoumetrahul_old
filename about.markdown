I am a 31 YO research scholar pursuing my PhD at NIMHANS.
My physical self can be located in Human sleep research lab in the Dept. of Neurophysiology, NIMHANS.
My PhD work revolves around understanding the neural networks involved in visual working memory and how transcranial
alternating current stimulations can affect network oscillations. Part of this question is extended to understand the deficits in working memory performance in Schizophrenia patients.
You can look at my reasearch profile either in Google scholar or ResearchGate.

I am more like a dog chasing multiple cars or like a kid in a candy store.
I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
I have a masters degree in Medical Electronics.
I worked as an associate software enginner with an MNC.
I have an MPhil in Neurosciences.
Currently in second year of PhD program in Neurophysiology.

I am interested in Neuroscience and science in general.
I love teaching and is my goto thing seeking purpose in life.
I love travelling and exploring places (But need to break lots of laziness, fear of unknown and procrastination barriers)
I am happily married to a wonderful girl :)

Have a look at the posts in the homepage for various topics.
PS: Views are my own and anyone is welcome to disagree. I am not a purist.
