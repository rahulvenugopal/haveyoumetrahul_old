I am a 31 YO hooman with Y chromosome. Currently I am pursuing my PhD journey at NIMHANS.
You can look at my reasearch profile either in Google scholar or ResearchGate

I am more like a dog chasing multiple cars or like a kid in a candy store.
I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering
I have a masters degree in Medical Electronics
I have an MPhil in Neurosciences 
Currently in second year of PhD program in Neurophysiology

I am interested in Neuroscience and science in general.
I love teaching and is my goto thing seeking purpose in life
I love travelling and exploring places (But need to break lots of laziness, fear of unknown and procrastination)
I am happily married to a wonderful girl :)

Have a look at the posts in the homepage for various topics.
PS: Views are my own and anyone is welcome to disagree. I am not a purist
